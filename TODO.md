Enhancements
------------

* 'first-out-first-in' processing (as opposed to current 'loop' design) should allow for faster (or at least more uniform) pool-refilling overall
* Separate threads for pending/running/completed queues (either rather than or in addition to per-pool threads)
* Require 'authorization key' (returned in POST JSON) to DELETE via the API
